# My first React App Template

This template is coming from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKdQjQX1Pko&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery">Tutorial</a> from this great channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery">Tutorial</a>

<br>
It is setting a basic API consuming app with a rating system using Material UI and Google Maps API to display and allow the ability to search globally.
<br>
<br>
This repo has everything up to 46:00 mark where the instructor starts to implement the API's the app will consume. As I do not plan to use these specific API's and this is meant to be a generic tool I will leave the template at this part of the build.
